12. **Interpreter Pattern**

13. **Iterator Pattern**

14. **Observer Pattern**

15. **State Pattern**

16. **Strategy Pattern**

17. **Template Method Pattern**

18. **Visitor Pattern**

19. **Model-View-Controller Pattern**

20. **Publisher-Subscriber Pattern**

## Getting Started

To explore these design patterns, simply navigate through the repository's folders. Each pattern has its dedicated folder containing Python code examples and explanations.
